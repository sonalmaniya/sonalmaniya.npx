<!-- # Demo.

# Why?

I created this command as sort of my portfolio that can be accessed from any terminal with Node.js. I was very curious to see if such a thing could be accomplished and it turned out to be quite easy in the end.

<br />
<br />

# Run.

Assuming you have Node.js installed, to run this command, simply do.

```sh
npx sonalmaniya
```
